# Daft Mover

**Supports Unreal Engine 5.5**

**! Main is not currently stable, use with extreme caution. For stable version, use the FGMovement branch !**

Custom implementation ontop of Mover.

Worth noting that this plugin was originally made when Mover was still on main, so needless to say since this time there has been some extremely breaking API changes, if you used this plugin previously and are now upgrading to newer versions - expect that almost everything will be broken and you have a lot of work to do, as such the old version of this plugin "FGMovement" for 5.4 has been deprecated under a branch, going forward main will contain "Daft Mover" which you can consider the 2.0 of the original plugin with the severely breaking changes bringing it up to compatibility with the newer API.
